# Data Structures and Algorhythms in JS¹: implementations with tests

¹ Well, mostly in TypeScript.

This repository is about DSA _basic_ stuff and preparation for programming interviews:
sorts, data structures, popular algorithms, and coding problems.

I created it for myself, just to get a comfy setup for learning and training.


## How to train
The idea is quite simple: study a problem, then open a test on the desired topic,
delete the implementation and write it again so that the tests pass.


## Install
```shell
nvm use
yarn install
yarn test
```

### Platforms
* Try [codewars.com](www.codewars.com/r/vGDUvQ
  ): it is the most basic and comfortable way to solve the coding problems.
The link is referral (I will receive some points if you register).
* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): the platform has various preparation kits and a good browser code editor.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): another good platform, quite similar to others (you need a premium account to unlock the official explanation to the solution).
* **Grokking Algorithms** book by Aditya Bhargava: a perfect start for the beginners on DSA topic.
