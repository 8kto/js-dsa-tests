 * Time Complexity: O(Log max(a, b))
 *
 * GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them.
 * A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common prime factors.
 *
 * Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
 * The algorithm is based on the below facts.
 *
 * If we subtract a smaller number from a larger (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change.
 * So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
 * Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
