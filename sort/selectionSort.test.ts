/**
 * In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm.
 * It has an O(n^2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists,
 * and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
 *
 * Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms
 * in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
 *
 * The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items
 * which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist
 * of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
 * Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list.
 * The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist,
 * exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order),
 * and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
 *
 * One thing which distinguishes selection sort from other sorting algorithms is
 * that it makes the minimum possible number of swaps, n âˆ’ 1 in the worst case.
 *
 * O(n^2)
